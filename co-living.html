					<h5>
						An experimental interactiondesign exploring co-living.
					</h5>

					<h5>
						We wanted to facilitate a dialog on how co-living in the near future might look like. We wanted to use humor to underline the experimental qualities of the design. We highlighted emerging technology as the Internet of Things, smarts homes and something as simple as what 'the home' might look like in the near future. The anti-polishedness was a way of producing MVP to help get people to talk and discuss the topic without setteling on assumptions. I used the method of reframing and ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô questions to create a design space that was open for new interpretations of what co-living could be.

					<h5> 
						In a world where problems becomes ever more complicated where we are faced with climate crisis we need to disrupt our common assumption a bit. Design is a powerful tool to do so if done right.

					<h5>
						To develop the prototypes I went through a lot of material explorations with both cardboard, different 3D print material, fabric, yarn, filt and LED's to explore the qualities of the material and how to combine them.
					</h5>

					<h5> 
						My process for making the prototypes are especially centred around crafting and rapid prototyping as a MVP's.

						This might seem silly to some but non the less it lead me to create an innovative space from where I encouraged the test persons to think outside the box and be creative.

						Using design as fictional narratives or thought Experiments-constructions are not merely kinds of fictions but design tools that narrates new worlds. 
					</h5>	

					<h5> I created an IKEA catalogue to make the ideas real and to think them further both in terms of silliness, playfulness and as ethical encounters.

					<h5>
						To create a research based design fiction, I had to create a bridge between the audience‚Äôs perception of their world and the fictional 	element of the concept. When expressed through the physical things, we move the audience closer to our own worlds and step away from the world of science fiction.

					<h5>
						Practicing RtD and engaging in the making of worlds as a prototyping tool within design I was able to work within a holistic opportunity space rather than a problem space. My rationalization of the design was grounded in more emotional, playful and ethical based argumentation over cognitively based (not to say that one rules out the other). To argument for more emotionally based design decisions I turned to design synthesis as a sense-making practice. This abductive way of making sense through chaos is not non-valid argumentation rather a creative and structured mindset to organise data. Doing design research that is centered around the near future  makes visible the non-visible and designs: ‚Äúa higher quality conversation‚Äù with a context that encourage reflection through the communication of a concept. Yet the physical presence of the thing becomes the manifestation of our values and how we engage in life.
