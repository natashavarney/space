                    <h5>Today we seem to be experiencing a rationalisation of our senses. We have neglected the importance of noticing the things that are all around us because we are so obsessed with moving from A-B. Through an embodied design practices, I have used Sense-ethnography and walkshops to engage in opening a design field of nuances, refinement and everyday observations of reflection to amplify the need to revise our understanding of the senses and how nature influence every aspect of our day to day experiences. </h5>

These are among other Emplaced Ethnography, Unexpected, Walkshops, Emotional Biosensing, Walking with Video, Clustering & Affinity Diagramming </h5>

										<h5>We analyse our data from the different qualitative and quantitative methods in different ways. Nevertheless by structurering them into themes using etc. Affinity Diagramming and thematic coding we are able to create a shared mindset and to communicate in more precise and coherent ways about your design ideas. </h5>
